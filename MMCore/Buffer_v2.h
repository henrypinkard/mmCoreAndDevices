// DESCRIPTION:   Generic implementation of a buffer for storing image data and
//                metadata. Provides thread-safe access for reading and writing
//                with configurable overflow behavior.
//
// The buffer is organized into slots (BufferSlot objects), each of which
// supports exclusive write access and shared read access. Read access is
// delivered using const pointers and is counted via an atomic counter, while
// write access requires acquiring an exclusive lock. This ensures that once a
// read pointer is given out it cannot be misused for writing.
